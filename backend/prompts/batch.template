Create {{.NumCards}} concise, simple, straightforward and distinct Anki
cards to study the following article, each with a front and back. Avoid repeating
the content in the front on the back of the card. In particular, if the front is
a question and the back an answer, avoid repeating the phrasing of the question as
the initial part of the answer. Avoid explicitly referring to the author or the
articles or images in the cards, and instead treat the article or images as
factual and independent of the author. Do not have a tendency to fall into repeating
patterns when creating the cards. For instance, if the first card you create has a one-word
answer, don't be likely to formulate subsequent cards to have simple answers as well.
Use the following format (structure your output using json):

{
    "cards": [
        {
            "front: "front section of card 1 (always a string)",
            "back": "back section of card 1 (always a string)"
        },
        {
            "front: "front section of card 2 (always a string)",
            "back": "back section of card 2 (always a string)"
        },
    ]
]

... and so on.

Attached you will find the articles and images.
Your response should ONLY contain the JSON object and nothing else.
Make sure you format the json properly.

That a deep breath and generate away! You got this!
