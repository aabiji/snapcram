- Overhaul the UI and add animations
  Colors (inspired by Claude): bg = #F5F4ED, font = Copernicus
- Add a authentication and settings page
- Allow the user to edit their flashcards
- Figure out how to create flashcard decks from unlimited assets
  What we could do is generate small sets of flashcards from each
  batch (group of assets). When we've processed all the batches,
  we can combine all the flashcard sets together then prompt the
  llm *again* to cohesively tie all the flashcards together,
  remove lower quality flashcards, create new flashcards from the
  flashcards, etc. Then that final combined set of flashcards is
  return to the user.
- A spaced repetition algorithm to deliberately shows you cards
  you're less confident about more frequently
- Switch from sqlite to postgresql
- Port to UI over to the web
- Also support pdfs, word files, powerpoint slides, audio recordings, etc
- Make the model also optionally add diagrams and images to the flashcards
- Test the flashcard generation. Do the flashcards work for math, for other subjects, etc?
- Be able to export the flashcards to anki
- Improve the readme and the docker container
- Host the backend (and website) and publish to the play store
- Find and load existing flashcard decks (not necessarily ai generated)
- Extend the idea further and generate mock tests
- Film devlogs, etc
